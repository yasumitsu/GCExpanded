Regrettably, poor Hamous never did save up enough money to purchase that mini-van that he desperately wanted. So he did the next best thing and stole one just outside of Paris. Actually it was an ice cream truck. He was seen headed towards Istanbul in it before miraculously showing up in Arulco. There, he joined the local A.I.M. force and helped overthrow Deidranna, securing his place with the organization once more for his bravery.\nHe is saving up money yet again, now both for a new mini-van (his "borrowed" ice-cream truck was blown to smithereens by an army tank at the outskirts of Meduna), and to cover litigation charges by Une Glace Ã  Paris.'),
